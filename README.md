This is the official code for the paper " Predicting the Stereoselectivity of Chemical Reactions by Composite Machine Learning Method."
All the data used for the analysis are shared in the folder "data."
All the data we used for the analysis are shared in the folder "code."
Specifically, we differentiate the code based on the name of the machine learning method we used, including "SVR," "DT," "GBR," "Lasso," and "RF."
The indexe of figures and tables listed in the code follows the same index in the paper.
